# LabelStudio-To-YOLO-Format
This project provides a solution to the limitation of Label Studio's video annotation format, which does not natively support the YOLO (You Only Look Once) format. Label Studio is a powerful tool for annotating data, but for users working with YOLO-based object detection, the lack of direct YOLO export has been a hurdle.

This project bridges that gap by converting Label Studio annotations into the YOLO format, making it easier to integrate your annotated datasets with YOLO-based training pipelines. With just a few simple steps, you can seamlessly transform your Label Studio annotations into the precise format YOLO expects.
